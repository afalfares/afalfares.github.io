I'm a recent MS in ECE graduate from Carnegie Mellon University. I'm interested in backend web development and love exploring ways to make web applications more secure. I also enjoy the occasional CTF challenge, especially the pwn and web ones - they’re a fun way to level up my skills while keeping things exciting. Right now, I’m actively looking for opportunities in Kuwait where I can apply my skills, learn from others, and contribute to building more secure, reliable applications.
